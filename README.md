# Speed-detection-of-a-moving-object
A speed detection of a moving object algorithm designed on MATLAB.

# Tools & Applications
- Matlab

# Description
The matlab program calculates the speed of a moving car.The implementation is basically done by finding two frames of video binarizing them and then finding there centre
of areas and then we find the distance between the centres of two binarized frames. The answer is then converted to meters per second which is displayed.
